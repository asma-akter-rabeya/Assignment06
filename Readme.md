1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

        #Answer: Some key difference between var , let and const are:
                (1) var is accessible before it is declared (initialized as undefined), but let and const cannot be accessed before declaration (they are in a "Temporal Dead Zone").
                (2) var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped ({}).
                (3) var can be reassigned and redeclared, but let can only be reassigned, and const can neither be reassigned nor redeclared.
